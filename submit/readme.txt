We implement parallel GPU based algorithms to solve linear system, invert matrices and compute LU factorizations.

We use two ways to solve linear system. One is based on Gaussian Elimination. Another is based on Gauss-Jordan method.

For inverting matrices, the program is based on Gauss-Jordan method.

For LU factorizations, we also use two ways to solve the problem. One is unblocked LU factorization. Another is blocked LU factorization.

We implement sequential alogrithms, and CUDA based GPU parallel prgrams, and OpenCL based GPU parallel programs.
